# 📊 The Android App Market: Data Analysis & Visualization  

## 🔍 Overview  
This project explores the **Google Play Store** app market using **data analysis and visualization techniques**. The dataset includes thousands of free and paid apps, along with user reviews and sentiment analysis. Using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib**, we uncover insights into app categories, pricing strategies, user ratings, and sentiment trends.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of two key CSV files:  
- **`app.csv`** – Contains details on apps (name, category, ratings, reviews, installs, type, price, etc.).  
- **`user_reviews.csv`** – Includes user reviews, sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative), and polarity scores.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Libraries  
🔹 **Python** – Data analysis & processing  
🔹 **Pandas, NumPy** – Data cleaning & transformation  
🔹 **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization   

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations  
✔️ **App Ratings & Reviews** 📈 – Understanding the distribution of ratings and review trends.  
✔️ **Category-Wise Performance** 📊 – Top-performing categories based on installs & ratings.  
✔️ **Free vs. Paid Apps** 💰 – Analyzing the impact of pricing on user engagement.  
✔️ **Sentiment Analysis** 📝 – Extracting user review sentiments using polarity scores.  
✔️ **Correlation Analysis** 🔗 – Exploring relationships between app size, price, and popularity.  

## 📌 Future Improvements  
✔️ Integrate **Machine Learning models** for app rating prediction.  
✔️ Build an **interactive dashboard** using Plotly or Streamlit.  
✔️ Enhance **NLP analysis** for deeper user sentiment insights.
